\subsection{Context}

EMF is the first substantial event of its kind in the UK, however it
follows in the footsteps of a number of larger events in Europe and the
US, collectively known as ``hacker camps''.

It should be noted that the word ``hacker'' is used by us and these
other camps - in a different way to that generally understood by the
mainstream media - to refer to technology enthusiasts. The European
hacker camps tend to have a focus towards legitimate security research,
however we're attempting to have a broader reach than just this.

We are attempting to follow in the footsteps of these successful camps
in terms of organisation, and a brief summary of them is below:
