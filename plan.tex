\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is the UK's largest technology-focused camping festival:
A three-day event for people with an inquisitive mind and an interest in science, engineering,
technology, crafts, DIY, and computer security.

EMF can be seen as a cross between a conference and a music festival, with talks and workshops on a wide
range of subjects. In addition, there will be demonstrations and installations by attending
members of the community.

EMF is a non-profit event run by a dedicated team of volunteers who have
experience staffing and organising events for the European maker community.

\subsection{Context}

EMF 2014 is the third event, and the second major camping festival, organised by
Electromagnetic Field Ltd.

EMF follows in the footsteps of a number of similar events across Europe and the USA,
the most recent being the successful 3500-capacity Observe Hack Make festival last year
in the Netherlands.

Our last three-day festival in 2012 brought more than 600 attendees to Pineham Park in
Milton Keynes for talks and workshops on topics ranging from genetic modification to electronics,
blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking,
computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to beer brewing.

\section{Site}

The event will be located in farmland at the Hounslow Hall Estate, Newton Longville.
The site is operated by Explore The Country and EMF has a license to use it between
Monday 25\superscript{th} August and Thursday 4\superscript{th} September.

Where not otherwise secure, the site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence for security purposes.
The secure licensing perimeter will surround the event tents and all camping areas.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be
exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout may be found on the attached site plan.

\section{Licensing}

We will be applying for a Premises License to cover the sale of alcohol
and the provision of regulated entertainment. The proposed licensed hours are:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
Friday 29\th August & 1200 -- 0200 \\
Saturday 30\th August & 1200 -- 0200 \\
Sunday 31\st August & 1200 -- 0100 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

All bar staff will receive a briefing on legislation and event policies before starting work.
The bar will operate a "Challenge 21" policy for dealing with under-18s, and will only accept
approved documents as proof of age. Bar staff will be instructed not to serve customers who are
drunk, and will be familiarised with the strength of the drinks they are serving.

A full price list will be provided at each bar, which will include the ABV levels of each drink
and the measured quantity in which spirits are being sold.

Drinks will not be served in glass containers. Attendees will be advised not to bring
glass onto the site.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however we will provide some live music,
as well as ancillary recorded music between talks.

\subsection{Public Nuisance \& Noise}

The site is not in direct proximity to any residential areas, and is located in a
natural dip in the land. As EMF is a camping festival, attendees are not expected to leave the site
at night, so there is a low risk of attendees causing public nuisance outside the site.

Nonetheless, we are mindful of the need to keep noise nuisance
to an absolute minimum. Noise generated by amplified music will be monitored around the site.
No amplified music will be permitted on site outside of the licensed hours.

\section{Children}

The event will be family-friendly with a dedicated children's area. Under-12s will receive free tickets
and under-18s will receive a discount.

An DBS-checked volunteer will always be on-call in case of a lost child situation.

\section{Toilets \& Sanitation}

As there are no toilet facilities on site, a minimum of 20 toilets and 5 urinals, as well as two disabled toilets,
will be provided. This is well in excess of the recommendations made by the HSE Event Safety Guide.

Mains water is available on site and taps and washbasins will be provided. Showers will also be provided.

\section{Food}

Food on site will be provided by commercial food concessions. Food hygeine certificates will be checked and kept on file for all food vendors.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

All key members of staff will be issued with a radio and trained in its use. A "control" member of staff will be contactable by radio at all times and will have emergency contact details for the organisation team.

\subsection{Staffing Levels}

Staff levels will be allocated as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Role & Period & Staff \\
\hline
Main Gate & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Information Point & 24/7 & \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 2 -- 5 \\
Per Tent & During Talks & 2 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

As well as these staff, a dedicated duty event manager will be on call at all times during the event.

In the unlikely event staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{First Aid}

First aid will be provided by our own trained volunteers, including those with advanced St John's Ambulance
qualifications and previous experience in large-scale festival first aid.

During setup and teardown there will be at least one qualified first-aider on duty.

During the event, there will be at least two qualified first aiders are on duty at all times.

\section{Traffic management and parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport as much as possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed, and vehicles will not be allowed on site without a pass.

Around 900 vehicles are expected to park on site, and the capacity of the car parking fields is in excess of 1000.
The car parking fields are located some distance away from the festival site, and a shuttle service will run between
the two locations.

A scheduled shuttle bus service will be provided between the site and Bletchley station.
\section{Fire risk}
\subsection{Sources of ignition}

The main sources of ignition at EMF are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hot exhaust from generators
\item LPG appliances in catering area
\item Camp fires and gas appliances used by attendees
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps to minimise risk}
The following steps will be taken to mitigate risks of fire:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generators provided by EMF will be sited away from all combustible materials in accordance with supplier's guidance.
\item No other generators will be allowed on site.
\item Combustible materials will be stored away from structures.
\item Firefighting equipment will be provided on site and make staff aware of its location. Fire extinguishers will be sited in all event tents.
\item Fire lanes will be provisioned within camping areas and clearly marked.
\item Camp fires will not be allowed on the ground.
\item Attendees will be instructed not to use gas appliances in tents.
\item Fire lanes will provided in camp sites and monitored to be kept clear.
\item Roving staff will be instructed to monitor the site for any fire hazards and contact control over radio.
\item Catering/concessions staff will be made aware of regulations regarding gas storage.
\item Catering area will be sited well away from camping area.
\item Sufficient access to the site will be provided and maintained clear for access of fire appliances.
\item Weather conditions will be monitored in case of very dry conditions raising the risk of spread of fire through vegetation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emergency plan}

All stewards will be briefed on steps to take if a fire is discovered which will include alerting other staff by radio and, if necessary, evacuating attendees.
