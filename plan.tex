\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is a three-day camping festival for people
with an inquisitive mind and an interest in science, engineering,
technology, DIY, and computer security. 

EMF will be a cross between a tech conference and a music festival, with talks and workshops on a wide
range of subjects. In addition, there will be demonstrations and installations by attending
members of the community.

EMF is a non-profit event run by a dedicated team of volunteers who have
experience staffing and organising events for the UK maker community.

\subsection{Key Information}

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Context}

EMF is the first substantial event of its kind in the UK, however it
follows in the footsteps of a number of larger events in Europe and the
US, collectively known as ``hacker camps''.

It should be noted that the word ``hacker'' is used by us and these camps
-- in a different way to that generally understood by the
mainstream media -- to refer to technology enthusiasts. The European
hacker camps tend to have a focus towards legitimate security research,
however we're attempting to have a broader reach than just this.

We are attempting to follow in the footsteps of these successful events
in terms of organisation, and a brief summary of them is below:

\begin{tabular}{ l l r }
Event & Year & Capacity \\
\hline
Chaos Communication Camp & 2011 & 3500 \\
Hacking at Random & 2009 & 3000 \\
Chaos Communication Camp & 2007 & 2300 \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Site}

The event will be located in Pineham Park, Milton Keynes. 
The site is owned by The Parks Trust and EMF has a license to use it between
Tuesday 28\superscript{th} August and Tuesday 4\superscript{th} September.

Where not otherwise secure, the site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence for security purposes.
Camping will be in the same field as the event tents, and all of this
will be within the secure licensed perimeter.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be
exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout may be found on the attached site plan.

\section{Licensing}

We will be applying for a Temporary Event Notice to cover the sale of alcohol
and the provision of regulated entertainment. The proposed licensed hours are:

\begin{tabular}{ l r }
Friday 31\st August & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Saturday 1\st September & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Sunday 2\nd September & 1200 -- 2300 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

All bar staff will receive a briefing on legislation and event policies before starting work.
The bar will operate a "Challenge 21" policy for dealing with under-18s.

Drinks will be served in plastic or paper containers. Measures will be taken to
stop attendees from bringing glass on site.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however we are aiming to provide some live music,
as well as ancillary recorded music between talks.

The site is close to a residential area, and we are mindful of the need to keep noise nuisance
to an absolute minimum. No amplified music will be permitted on site outside of the licensed hours.

\section{Under-18s}

Although predominantly an adult-focused event, under-18s will be allowed on site with a ticket. It will be
made clear that children must be supervised by parents or guardians at all times.

An extended CRB checked volunteer will always be on-call in case of a lost child situation.

\section{Food}

Food on site will be sold by commercial food vendors. Food hygeine certificates will be checked for all vendors.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

All groups of staff will be issued with a radio and trained in its use. A "control" member of staff will be
contactable by radio at all times and will have emergency contact details for the organisation team.

Minimum staffing levels will be as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l l l }
Role & When & Staff \\
\hline
Front Gate & 24/7 & 2 \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 \\
Tent staff & During talks & 2 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 2 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

In the unlikely event these staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{First Aid}

We will make sure two qualified first aiders are on duty at all times.

\section{Traffic management and parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport as much as possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed,
and vehicles will not be allowed on site without a pass.

A minibus shuttle service will be operated between Milton Keynes station, Coachway, and the site.

\section{Weather Contingency}

The site is located on a flood plain, and consideration has been made to both unusually sunny and unusually rainy
eventualities. The site drains well, but a contingency fund has been set aside for this.

The event will not be allowed to go ahead if there is reasonable belief the site will flood.
