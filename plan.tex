\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is a three-day camping festival for people
with an inquisitive mind and an interest in science, engineering,
technology, DIY, and computer security. It will be a cross between a
tech conference and a music festival, with talks and workshops on a wide
range of subjects.

EMF is a non-profit event run by a dedicated team of volunteers who have
experience staffing and organising events for the UK maker community.

\subsection{Key Information}

\begin{tabular}{ l l }
Event Date & Friday 31st August - Sunday 2nd September 2012 \\
Capacity & 479 paid camping, 20 unpaid guests/staff \\
Ticket price & Â£75--100 (exact price to be confirmed), parking passes extra \\
Location & Pineham Park, Milton Keynes \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Context}

EMF is the first substantial event of its kind in the UK, however it
follows in the footsteps of a number of larger events in Europe and the
US, collectively known as ``hacker camps''.

It should be noted that the word ``hacker'' is used by us and these camps
-- in a different way to that generally understood by the
mainstream media -- to refer to technology enthusiasts. The European
hacker camps tend to have a focus towards legitimate security research,
however we're attempting to have a broader reach than just this.

We are attempting to follow in the footsteps of these successful events
in terms of organisation, and a brief summary of them is below:

\begin{tabular}{ l l r }
Event & Year & Capacity \\
\hline
Toorcamp & 2013 & 1000 \\
Chaos Communication Camp & 2011 & 3500 \\
Hacking at Random & 2009 & 3000 \\
Chaos Communication Camp & 2007 & 2300 \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Site}

The event will be located in Pineham Park, Milton Keynes. 
The site is owned by The Parks Trust and EMF has a license to use it between
Tuesday 28\superscript{th} August and Tuesday 4\superscript{th} September.

The site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence for security purposes.
Camping will be in the same field as the event tents, and all of this
will be within the secure licensed perimeter.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be
exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout can be found on the attached site plan.

\section{Licensing}

We will be applying for a Temporary Event Notice to cover the sale of alcohol
and the provision of regulated entertainment. The proposed licensed hours are:

\begin{tabular}{ l r }
Friday 31\st August & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Saturday 1\st September & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Sunday 2\nd September & 1200 -- 2300 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

All bar staff will receive a briefing on legislation and event policies before starting work.

If under-18s are permitted on site, the bar will operate a "Challenge 21" policy.

Drinks will be served in plastic or paper containers. Measures will be taken to
stop attendees from bringing glass on site.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however we aim to provide some live music,
as well as ancillary music between talks.

The site is close to a residential area, and we are mindful of the need to keep noise annoyance to a minimum.
No amplified music will be permitted on site outside of the licensed hours.

\section{Under-18s}

Electromagnetic Field was conceived as a family event, and some of the organisers are involved in
running technology-related events for children.

However, the organisation team does not have experience running events with children. We are
currently seeking advice on whether it will be feasible to allow children. If we are not comfortable
then the event will nonetheless go ahead as an over-18 event.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

Staffing levels will be as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l l l }
Role & When & Staff \\
\hline
Front Gate & 24/7 & 2 \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 \\
Tent staff & During talks & 3 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 3--4 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1--2 \\
Management & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

In the event these staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{First Aid}

We will make sure two qualified first aiders are on duty at all times.

\section{Traffic management and parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport as much as possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed,
and vehicles will not be allowed on site without a pass.

A minibus shuttle service will be operated between Milton Keynes station and the site.
